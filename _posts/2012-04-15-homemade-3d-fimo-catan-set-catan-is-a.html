<p>Catan is a civilization-building board game that I&rsquo;ve become very fond of. The basis of the game is that you land on an island, the island of Catan, and you and your fellow players must settle it and build your civilization. Through the placements of cities and settlements, you gain resources that you can use for your building needs. Building leads to points, and 13 points wins the game. Catan has been building in popularity for the last decade or so; it has virtually no advertising, and has been spread through word of mouth. Wired magazine just did a big <a href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/17-04/mf_settlers" target="_blank">article</a> on Catan and what separates it from traditional board games.<br/><br/> The <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/image/268855" target="_blank">standard game</a> has cardboard tiles, with wooden pieces. The build is actually pretty high quality for your standard run-of-the-mill board game. In addition, there is a limited-edition, <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/image/99184" target="_blank">clay resin 3D set</a> that you can play with - albeit at a cost of $400 and up. I thought the look of this set was awesome, and after reading that others had managed to duplicate the technique, I wanted to give my own a shot. However, I had a much different look in mind - I wanted it to look more cartoony than realistic, as the resin pieces looked. I had already done a bit of molding before with Fimo, and I thought I would give it a try.</p>
