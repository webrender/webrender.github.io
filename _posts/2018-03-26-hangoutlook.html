<p>Once upon a time, there was a company. And the company ran Gsuite and used Google Hangouts and all was well. Hangout boxes setup in the conference rooms displayed upcoming schedules & let you connect to calls.</p>
<p>But then the company was acquired and had to switch to Outlook, and there was felt a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of meetings suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. Outlook meeting room calendars could not connect to the Hangout boxes, and conference rooms were in chaos.</p>

<p>Hangoutlook was created as a solution to this chaos. It parses an ICS calendar URL and displays a meeting room screen which looks and acts exactly like Hangouts, with some added bonuses:</p>
<li>Parses Google Hangout URLs, as well as custom URL patterns for other call URLs</li>
<li>Generates a meeting name if there's none specified</li>
<li>Works with anything that can generate an ICS file</li>
<li>Alt-click meetings to join them in present mode</li>
