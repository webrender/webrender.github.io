<h4>standup-helper</h4>

<p>At Disqus, teams meet for a daily standup to check-in and share the latest updates on projects and ask questions. Since we have a distributed team working across different time zones, having standup at a fixed time isn’t ideal. We experimented with a few standup bots for Slack but found that they didn’t provide enough context around what people were working on. Specifically, we wanted a better way to connect a developer’s update to the related Trello card(s).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To solve this problem, we created Standup Helper, an open source Slackbot. It integrates with Trello by linking people’s responses to the cards they’re assigned to.</p>
<p>Using this information, Standup Helper creates an interactive, asynchronous dashboard that our team can use to augment our standups with useful, persistent data such as:</p>
<li>Active/inactive tasks, linked to their corresponding Trello cards</li>
<li>Recently merged PRs and PRs in review (integrates with Phabricator)</li>
<li>Upcoming Out of Offices (integrates with an OOO ICS feed)</li>
<li>Custom notes, interrupt notifications, and sidebar requests</li>
<li>Standup Helper lets us get process out of the way so we can focus our standups around meaningful conversations.</li>
