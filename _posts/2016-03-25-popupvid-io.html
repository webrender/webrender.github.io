<p><a href="https://popupvid.io">popupvid.io</a> is an app that I created to help myself learn Angular.  You can see an example of it above - the site lets you choose a youtube video and overlay informational graphics in the style of the VH1 Pop-Up Video series. You can then share that overlaid video with others or embed it in a website.</p>
<p>I might pickup work on this project again at some point, but it would definitely require a major refactor, including a migration to a new framework.  In the meantime the source is <a href="https://github.com/webrender/popupvid.io">available on Github.</a>
