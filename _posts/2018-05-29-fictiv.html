<p>I've been working with Fictiv since 2018, first as a lead frontend developer; and since 2021, as an engineering manager. In my time there, I've led the launch of the multiple new products, as well as countless features for the user-facing, admin-facing, and computational geometry teams.</p>

<p>In addition to my coding responsibilities, I've worked to mentor my fellow developers in best practices for modern frontend development and user experience. As an engineering manager, I have spun up several new development teams at the company, as well as taken existing teams and optimized their processes around productivity and developer wellbeing.</p>

<p>I've been working with Fictiv in a fully-remote capacity since the beginning of 2019.</p>
