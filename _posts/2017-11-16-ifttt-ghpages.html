<p>This is a node app (which you can run on <a href="https://glitch.com/~ifttt-ghpages">Glitch</a> for free) that lets you create new posts in a Jekyll-based Github Pages site, based on IFTTT actions.  This lets you automatically aggregate a variety of networks and communication mediums into your static blog without client-side javascript. It's used to generate many of the blog posts on this site!</p>
