<blockquote>
<p>The server is one of the actual Lightninghoof server blades used from 2005-2010 - Blizzard auctioned them off for charity several years ago. Â The front panel is signed by all the Lightninghoof attendees of Blizzcon 2013, in addition to any other denizens of the Hoof that happen to cross its path.</p>
