<blockquote><p>I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.</p>

<p>And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</p></blockquote>&#8212;<p>Steve Jobs, 1990</p><p><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/" target="_blank">https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/</a><br/></p>
