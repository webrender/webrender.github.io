<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think almost daily about how the world population in 1920 was a little over 1.7 billion and now it’s 7.2 billion.  It took over 200,000 years of human history for the world&#39;s population to reach 1 billion and only 200 years more to reach 7 billion and that’s scary as fuck.</p>&mdash; claudia turner (@cloudypianos) <a href="https://twitter.com/cloudypianos/status/1112057893715501056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2019</a></blockquote>
