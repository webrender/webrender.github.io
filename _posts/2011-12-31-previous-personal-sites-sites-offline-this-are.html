<p>This are the sites I had setup before this blog - I built the theme from scratch and featured a bunch of social media updates. I liked the outcome a lot, but in the end wordpress (and after that, pixelpost) was way more than I actually needed out of my site platform, so I decided to switch to the tumblr implentation now in use.</p>
<p><em>HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Wordpress, PixelPost</em></p>
