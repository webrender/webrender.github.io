<p><strong>Update 11/2017:</strong>After 6 years on Tumblr, I'm redoing my site and moving it to Github Pages.  I've included a screenshot of the Tumblr in the archived pages above.</p>
<p>This are the sites I had setup before this blog - I built the theme from scratch and featured a bunch of social media updates. I liked the outcome a lot, but in the end wordpress (and after that, pixelpost) was way more than I actually needed out of my site platform, so I decided to switch to the tumblr implentation now in use.</p>
<p><em>HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Wordpress, PixelPost</em></p>
