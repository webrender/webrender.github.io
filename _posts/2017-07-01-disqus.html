<h4>Disqus</h4>
<p>I worked with Disqus from 2015-2018, first as UI Engineer and now as Senior Frontend Developer.  In addition to my developer responsibilities, I also served as tech lead and scrum master/Trello master on multiple development teams, acting as the conduit between product and development teams to take projects from concept to release.</p>
