<h4>Disqus</h4>
<p>I've been working with Disqus since 2015, first as UI Engineer and now as Senior Frontend Developer.  In addition to my developer responsibilities, I've also served as tech lead and scrum master/Trello master on multiple development teams, acting as the conduit between product and development teams to take projects from concept to release.</p>
