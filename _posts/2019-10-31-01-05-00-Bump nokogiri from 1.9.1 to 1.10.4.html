> ## 1.10.4 / 2019-08-11

> ### Security
> 
> #### Address CVE-2019-5477 ([#1915](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915))
> 
> A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.

The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.
