<h4>phab-trello</h4>
<img src="/post_files/phab-trello-demo.gif"/><br/>
<p>Disqus uses Phabricator for our version control, and we use Trello for our scrum & task management. There was no integration between these tools, so we created one.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We decided to use webhooks rather than the Phabricator API, so that we could preserve separation of concerns and keep our Phabricator server from being directly exposed.</p>
