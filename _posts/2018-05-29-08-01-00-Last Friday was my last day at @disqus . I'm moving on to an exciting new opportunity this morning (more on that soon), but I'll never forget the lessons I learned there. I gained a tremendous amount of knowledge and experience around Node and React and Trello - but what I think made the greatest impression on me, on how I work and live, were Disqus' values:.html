title: Last Friday was my last day at @disqus . I'm moving on to an exciting new opportunity this morning (more on that soon), but I'll never forget the lessons I learned there. I gained a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience around Node and React and Trello - but what I think made the greatest impression on me, on how I work and live, were Disqus' values:

Be curious.
Be generous.
Be colorful.
Make an impact.
Speak your mind, respectfully.

These aren't just values to work by, they're values to live by. I'm thankful that Disqus gave me the opportunity to learn what it means to live these values with them. - Tweet
